    <h1>What is Agrarian Reform?</h1>
    <p><strong>Agrarian Reform</strong> are all those measures which are aimed at removing those obstacles which are
    responsible for keeping the agriculture sector <em>backward socially and economically</em>.
    Through these measures changes will be brought in the use and the distribution of the land, and the
    relationships between <strong>land lords</strong> and <strong>tenants</strong> will also be <u>improved</u>.
